# Doomed
3rd place winners in Unijam 2020!

The purpose of this project is to reflect on the dynamic situation regarding COVID-19 all over the world in 2020, 
and the effects it has on our everyday life. The pandemic has made the year 2020 one to be remembered for many 
wrong reasons, with bushfires and natural disasters, as well as political unrest being other causes of concern. 
Throughout the year, as university students, we had our own struggles of trying to adapt to a new way of learning, 
in an environment different from what we're used to - online classes. We thought it would be appropriate that we 
recreate our own online learning experience, and the difficulties as a result of the situation, in a light-hearted 
manner. Some references in this product will be better understood by university students (especially from the 
University of Melbourne), however, we welcome and encourage students and gamers everywhere to play and enjoy the 
game. 

As most university students would know, the platform Zoom is now used extensively in our everyday communications. 
We took inspiration from this and slightly tweaked the name to call it Doomed (considering online learning as... 
doomed).

Most of the visual elements presented in this visual novel were self-produced, with a few exceptions being listed 
in the "About" section from the menu.  We would like to give very special thanks to our friend Crystal Li for 
allowing us to feature her amazing artworks in our story; without her contributions, we would not have such a 
stunning visual novel... it would have been truly doomed.
