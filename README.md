# Doomed
Code participation in Unijam 2020, University of Melbourne Hackathon. **3rd place winners.** (Hooray)

This game was created to reflect on the life of students during the pandemic and the struggles of getting
used to online learning. It mimics the student experience of trying to connect with complete strangers 
through an online class.
